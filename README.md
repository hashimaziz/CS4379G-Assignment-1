- Description: This repo contains the code for assignment 1 in this course. The python notebook in a separate branch contains the analysis of the movie dataset.

- GitHub Repository: https://github.com/hashimaziz/CS4379G-Assignment-1

- To run the code in the notebook, simply click Run All at the top of the notebook. An important part to note is that the netflix_titles.csv file must be in the data directory (this should be correct by default)

- Findings:
    - Netflix had an increase in releases of content in 2015 and quickly spiked to it's peak in 2019. There was a bit of a dropoff in 2020 and 2021, however the reduction in 2021 could be due to a data collection cutoff or a decision made by Netflix.
    - Movie duration typically follows a normal distribution, with a mean around 100 minutes. TV show durations follow a heavily right-skewed distribution, with the majority of shows being 1 season long.
